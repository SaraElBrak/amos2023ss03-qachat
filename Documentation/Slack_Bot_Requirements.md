# Requirements for a Slack Bot

**Author:** Hafidz Arifin
**Date:** April 2023

## Requirements
* Slack account
* Slack API token
* Server to host our bot
* Bot functionality: Define before starting to write code. Defining the functionality involves deciding what your bot will do, how it will respond to user messages, and how it will interact with other apps.
* Programming language (popular options include Python, JavaScript, and Ruby)
* Comply with all Slack's terms and policies (see below under License Restrictions).

### Services Required for Implementation and Execution
* Bot will require access to the Slack API to interact with the Slack workspace.
* Bot will require the use of external services (E.g. Atlassian and the LLM).

###  License Restrictions
* Must comply with the
    * [Slack API Terms of Service](https://slack.com/terms-of-service/api)
    * [Slack App Developer Policy](https://api.slack.com/developer-policy)
    * [Slackâ€™s Brand Guidelines](https://slack.com/media-kit)
    * [Acceptable Use Policy](https://slack.com/acceptable-use-policy)
    * [Slack App Security Review](https://api.slack.com/security-review)
    * [(Slack App Directory Agreement if we put in app directory)](https://api.slack.com/slack-app-directory-agreement)
* Must comply with any licensing requirements for external services used in its implementation (E.g. Atlassian and the LLM).

###  Development Effort
* On average, between 2-6 weeks to create and implement a basic Slack Bot.
* More complex bots, such as those requiring NLP services or extensive integrations, may take several months to develop.
* It depends on several factors such as the
    * complexity of the language model
    * amount of training data available
    * quality of the training data
    * level of customization required

### Other Requirements
* Slack App Developer Policy
    * **Security:** Data security is important and must be properly configured, stored and served with strong encryption; developers are prohibited from compromising security, providing unauthorized access, using unpublished APIs, making misleading statements, transmitting viruses, and attempting to reverse engineer the Slack API.

    * **User Experience:** Applications and developers must provide a useful and appropriate user experience without degrading performance, offering inappropriate content, creating poor user experiences, displaying inappropriate communications, or neglecting appropriate customer assistance.

    * **Business:** Developers using Slack APIs must respect Slack's business practices, including not replicating or competing with core products, displaying ads, implying endorsement or partnership, or allowing access to the APIs by anyone else.

    * **Design:** Developers must create well-designed applications that do not violate Slack's brand guidelines, infringe on intellectual property rights, or make changes without Slack's review.

    * **Use of Data:** Developers and their applications are prohibited from collecting, using, and sharing user data without proper consent, contacting users outside of Slack without permission, and engaging in any form of surveillance or exploitation of data without approval from Slack and users.

    * **Law and Safety:** Applications must comply with all applicable laws and legal requirements, not create unsafe environments for users, and must not allow spamming, harassment, or impersonation of users.

    * **Export Controls:** Developers must classify their applications according to export regulations and only create applications with an ECCN of EAR99 or 5D992 for the Slack platform.

    * **A few additional requirements:** We require Applications and developers to follow this policy as well as all other Slack guidelines and policies including the Privacy Policy, Security Review, Partner Terms, Terms of Service, the API Terms of Service, and Submission Guidelines.
