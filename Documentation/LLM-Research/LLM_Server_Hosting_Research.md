## Method 1: On-Premises Hosting
* Confidentiality
    * higher level of confidentiality since the server and data are physically located within the organization's premises.
    * Access to server and data can be more tightly controlled, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
* Integrity
    * organization has full control over the server environment, which allows for better monitoring and ensuring data integrity.
    * Regular backups and disaster recovery plans can be implemented to mitigate the risk of data loss or corruption.
* Availability
    * provides greater control over server availability.
    * implementing redundant systems, backup power supplies, and network infrastructure to ensure high availability.
* Usability
    * may require dedicated IT resources for server maintenance, updates, and troubleshooting.
    * Technical expertise is necessary to manage and operate the server effectively.
* Possible Storage Space
    * allows for flexible storage options based on the organization's requirements.
* Access Speed
    * depends on the organization's internal network infrastructure.
* Comments
    * On-premises hosting offers a higher level of control and security but requires significant initial investment and ongoing maintenance.

## Method 2: Cloud Hosting
* Confidentiality
    * Public cloud hosting providers implement robust security measures to ensure confidentiality.
    * Data encryption, access controls, and network isolation help protect sensitive information.
* Integrity
    * Cloud hosting providers offer various tools and technologies to ensure data integrity.
    * Regular data backups, redundancy, and fault-tolerant infrastructure contribute to maintaining data integrity.
* Availability
    * Public cloud hosting typically provides high availability through distributed data centers and redundant infrastructure.
    * Service Level Agreements (SLAs) guarantee a certain level of uptime and availability.
* Usability
    * Cloud hosting simplifies server management and maintenance tasks.
    * The cloud provider handles infrastructure management, allowing the organization to focus on the LLM server's functionality.
* Possible Storage Space
    * Public cloud hosting offers scalable storage options.
    * The organization can easily increase or decrease the storage capacity based on current needs.
* Access Speed
    * The access speed for cloud hosting depends on the organization's internet connection.
    * Public cloud providers usually have robust networks and content delivery systems to ensure fast and reliable access.
* Comments
    * Public cloud hosting provides scalability, cost-effectiveness, and easy management but requires reliance on a third-party provider.
