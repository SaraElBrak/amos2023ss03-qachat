## About
*QAChat* evaluates newly developed LLMs for the use in a chatbot. The best suited network is trained on provided data that is collected from existing communication and documentation sources. The model is available for users to ask questions through a Slack bot integration.

## Vision
In recent times, LLMs have evolved rapidly, opening up new, previously unimagined areas of application. *QAChat* takes advantage of these developments to provide users with a simple and convenient point of contact. This allows a general language model to be trained on specific knowledge and thus answer context-specific questions through an interface integrated into an already used communication tool.
